Was trying to integrate interests into account modifications but it didn't like that even when it was commented out...
so i'm putting it here to reference if we want to include interests or just get rid of completely...


<div class="form-group">
                    {{ form.interests.label(class="form-control-label") }}
                    {% if form.interests.errors %}
                    {{ form.interests(class="form-control form-control-lg is-invalid") }}
                    <div class = "invalid-feedback">
                        {% for error in form.interests.errors %}
                            <span> {{ error }} </span>
                        {% endfor %}
                    </div>
                    {% else %}
                        {{ form.interests(class="form-control form-control-lg ") }}
                    {% endif %}
                </div>
