# Development Process and Setup
## Setting up API calls to fetch data from Sports Reference
To begin using the sports reference API:

## Setting up virtual python environment for development
We will be using virtual python environments (virtualenv) to separate python dev environment from other environments
### ```pip3 install virtualenv```
This installs virtualenv package used to create virtual python environments
### ```pip3 list```
See what version all of your python packages are at
### ```virtualenv project1_env```
Use this to create a new python virtual environment and you should create this on some local directory
### ```source project1_env/bin/activate```
This will create a new virtual environment where we can now easily manage what versions/what packages we are using: numpy, flask, sports_referenceAPI, etc.
### Installing other python packages needed for the project development
We can specify what versions we are using for this project and document that. These packages can be installed with a simple pip command: `pip install numpy` or whatever package you want to install.
